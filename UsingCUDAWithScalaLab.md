# Introduction #

`With ` **`ScalaLab`** `it is very easy to explore the powerful CUDA parallel processing framework. We describe the steps that are required. Currently we cover the Windows 64 based installation. `


# `Using CUDA in ScalaLab with Windows 64` #

`To use CUDA with ScalaLab with Windows 64 it is very easy. The required steps are:`

**`1. Install Visual Studio 2012 or another supported version.`**

**`2. Install CUDA 5.5 for Windows 64`**


`Then you can use all the ScalaLab's high level operations that utilize the CUDA threads of your NVIDIA graphics card to speedup computations. `
