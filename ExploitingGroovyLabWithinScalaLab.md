# Introduction #

`ScalaLab offers the option to execute also ` **`GroovySci`** `scripts, together with ` **`ScalaSci`** ` scripts from within the same environment!`


`We can execute ` **`GroovySci`** `scripts in the same way as ` **`ScalaSci`** `but by pressing ` `*F8*` ` instead ` ` of ` **`F6`**.

`For example: `

```


t = (0..10).step(0.01)  // as t = 0::0.01::10

x = sin(1.12*t)

plot(t,x)

```

`We can execute the code above, by selecting it, and pressing ` **`F8`**

`We can perform a (currently limited) tranfer of bindings from the ` **`GroovyShell`** ` to the Scala Interpreter, using ` **`CTRL-F8`**

`The` **`ConfigurationGroovy`** `controls some aspects of controlling the Groovy environment. For example, the ` **`Toggle INDY`** ` menu item, controls whether the Groovy compiler compiles using invoke dynamic bytecodes.  Also, the menu item: ` **`Transforms BigDecimals to Doubles`** ` controls whether an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) transformation is used to transform ` **`BigDecimals`** ` to ` **`Doubles`** `for efficiency.`

## `Import Statements` ##
`Since, the GroovyShell does not remember imported statements and code fragments, as the Scala interpreter does, the menu ` **`GroovyImports`** ` provides an alternative mechanism for buffering. We can buffer our import statements and code fragments, and then they will be issued automatically with each execution of a script with the GroovyShell. `


## `Toolboxes and the classpath of GroovyShell` ##

_`GroovyShell`_ `uses at its classpath the toolboxes installed at the classpath of the` _`Scala interpreter`_ `, i.e. the classpath available for ` _`GroovySci`_ ` is the same as for ` _`ScalaSci`_

`Therefore, if we want to utilize different toolboxes for GroovyLab, we can install them in ScalaLab, and then we should reset the GroovyShell, i.e. GroovyLab within ScalaLab shares the same toolboxes. `


## `Passing of bindings` ##

`The ability to pass computed values from the GroovyShell to the Scala Interpreter can sometimes be useful, in order to avoid to recompute these values. This transfer of bindings is accomplished with the ` **`Ctrl-F8`** ` keystroke.  We support transfer of bindings for the types: `

`Int, Short, Long, Double, Float, BigDecimal, Array[Double], Array[Array[Double]]`

`However, some basic types that exist in GroovyLab do not exist in ScalaLab and vice versa. Therefore, we support for these types a binding scheme that binds to equivalent types. Specifically:`

`The ` _`Matrix`_ `type of GroovyLab is converted to ScalaLab's` _`RichDouble2DArray`_

`The ` _`Vec`_ `type of GroovyLab, i.e. `_`groovySci.math.array.Vec`_ ` is converted to ` _`scalaSci.Vec`_
