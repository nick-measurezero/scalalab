# Comparison Table #

| **`Feature`** | **`ScalaLab`** | **`MATLAB`** |
|:--------------|:---------------|:-------------|
| **`Speed`**   | `Is faster for general scripts. Fast native BLAS operations supported with the JBLAS library obtain about the same speed as MATLAB's built-in operations. ` | `MATLAB wins when fast built-in operations are used. ` |
| **`Rich Extensible Language`**| `Clearly, Scala is a very rich and extensible language.`|`Limited extensibility using .m scripts. ` |
| **`Plotting`** | `ScalaLab has extensive plotting support using Java libraries. However, all the libraries are not integrated elegantly, up-to-now.` | `Standardized and well-documented plotting support.` |
| **`Libraries`** | `ScalaLab is compatible with all the Java scientific libraries. ` | `MATLAB has an extensive toolbox set.` |
| **`Easy of use`**  |`ScalaLab is very user-friendly but still much work needs to be done to "smooth" the user experience. ` | `Capable and productive user interface.` |
| **`Stand Alone Applications`**  |`It is very easy with ScalaLab to produce stand alone versions of the scripts that are executed on the Java Virtual Machine` | `MATLAB needs separate compilers.` |
